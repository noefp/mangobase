<p>
  Mango (<i>Mangifera indica</i> L.) (2n = 40) is a member of the Anacardiaceae family, which was domesticated at least 4000 years ago in different regions of Asia. Mangoes belong to the Mangifera genus, where there are between 45 and 69 species approximately, of which 26 species produce edible fruits. Mangoes are delicious fruits, which have great nutritional value. They are one of the major fruit crops worldwide, cultivated in more than 100 countries, with a production of more than 40 million tons in 2021 (FAOSTAT). India, China, Thailand, Indonesia, and Mexico are the top producer countries, although this crop is cultivated in tropical and subtropical regions of all continents but Antarctica, including regions far from the equator, such as the Mediterranean basin in the south of Europe, north of Africa and Middle East.
