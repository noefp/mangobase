  RNA-seq of <i>Mangifera indica</i> pulp (mesocarp) fruit ripening from cv. Tainong
</p>
<h4>Experimental Conditions (3 replicates):</h4>
  <ul>
    <li>Tainong pulp of fruits harvested at 40, 60, 80, and 90 days after flowering (DAF)</li>
    <li>Tainong pulp of fruits harvested at 90 days and stored for 0, 4, 8 and 12 days after harvest (DAH)</li>
  </ul>
<p>
  Samples were collected from the nursery at different stages of fruit development (40, 60, 80, and 90 days after the flowering stage began). 
  Fruit samples harvested at 90 days after the flowering were also kept for 4, 8, and 12 days in the laboratory 
  at a controlled temperature of 25°C and a humidity level of 95%. 
  Seven mangoes of an average weight of 100 ± 10 g were sampled. 
  The fruits were picked from different trees at the same positions on the day of fruit collection. 
  
  cDNA libraries were sequenced by PE sequencing (100 x 2) with Illumina HiSeq 2500 and normalized to TPM.

  From left to right, morphology of mango fruits at 40, 60, 80 days after flowering (DAF), and 4, 8 and 12 days stored after harvest (DAH).
</p>
<p>
  Samples labeled 40 DAF, 60 DAF, and 80 DAF are pulp samples of fruits harvested at 40, 60, and 80 days after flowering, respectively.<br>
  The sample labeled 0 DAH, corresponds to pulp of fruits harvested at 90 days after flowering.<br>
  Samples labeled 4 DAH, 8 DAH, and 12 DAH are pulp samples of fruits harvested at 90 days after flowering and stored for 4, 8, and 12 days, respectively.<br>
  <br>
  <b>DAF</b> = Days After Flowering
  <br>
  <b>DAH</b> = Days After harvest (harvested after 90 DAF)
