  RNA-seq of <i>Mangifera indica</i> (cultivar Keitt) peel tissue (±5 g) was randomly sliced from six fruit per biological replicate
   at harvest and after 2, 7, and 14 days of cold storage at 5 or 12°C, each with two biological replicates.
</p>
<h4>Experimental Conditions (2 replicates):</h4>
  <ul>
    <li>0 days harvest.</li>
    <li>2,7,14 days after harvest (DAH) stored at 5 celsius.</li>
    <li>2,7,14 days after harvest (DAH) stored at 12 celsius.</li>
  </ul>
<p>
  Mango (<i>Mangifera indica</i>, cultivar Keitt) were obtained from a commercial storage house (Mor Hasharon, Israel) 
  1–2 h after harvest and transported (1 h) to the Agricultural Research Organization (Israel). 
  Uniform, unblemished fruit weighing 424 ± 16 g were selected. 
  To remove the fruit sap, the fruit was dipped into water after harvest; no other treatment was applied after harvest. 
  cDNA libraries were sequenced by SE sequencing with Illumina Hiseq 2000 and normalized to TPM.
