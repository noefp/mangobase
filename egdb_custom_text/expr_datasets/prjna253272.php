  RNA-seq of <i>Mangifera indica</i> (cultivar Keitt) peel in two stages: ripe and overripe (storing them at room temperature approximately 20 °C and 60–65% relative humidity for 12 days).
</p>
<h4>Experimental Conditions (3 replicates):</h4>
  <ul>
    <li>Peel ripe.</li>
    <li>Peel overripe.</li>
  </ul>
<p>
  Mango (<i>Mangifera indica</i>, cultivar Keitt) fruit used for RNA-Seq profiling were obtained from a commercial store at Ithaca, New York, USA. 
  Peel samples from three fruit were pooled to create a single biological replicate and three independent biological replicates of both ripe and overripe fruit were analyzed. 
  cDNA libraries were sequenced by PE sequencing (100 x 2) with Illumina Hiseq 2500 and normalized to TPM.
